{"descriptionOfScenarios" :"\n#Using Branches\nHere you will learn how to create branches in your repository.\nThe branch allows you to work effectively in a completely new working directory.\nAs a result, in one repository ** _ Git _ ** there may be several different versions of the code base,\neach of which can be switched without changing directories.\n\nThe default branch in ** _ Git _ ** is called `` master``. Additional branches allow you to perform the same operations and commands,\nas on the master, such as committing, merging, and submitting changes.\nSince additional branches work just like master, they are ideal for prototyping and\n experiments, as any changes can be combined with master if necessary."}
