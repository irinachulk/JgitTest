{"descriptionOfScenarios" :"Committing files\n================\n\nIn this scenario,you will learn how to initialize a new repository _Git_ and commit files in the version control system.\n\nVersion control allows you to write changes to a file or set of files over time, which allows you to revert to a specific version if necessary. _Git_ is a distributed version control system, which means\nrelations of the locations of elements play a significant role in terms of the functioning of the system.\nThis means that instead\nsnapshot of the latest files you have a full storage mirror on your local computer. The repository tracks changes when they occurred and by whom.\n\n For more information about installing _Git_, you can refer to *[the official documentation] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Instal..)*."}
